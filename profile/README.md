# The Pi4J Project

This project is intended to provide **a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for
Java Programmers** to access the **full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform**. This project abstracts
the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to **focus on implementing
their application business logic**.

All documentation is available on [pi4j.com](https://pi4j.com/).

## Version 2 is the active project

As of Version 2.0, Pi4J will no longer include support for peripheral devices and add-on chipsets/boards as part of the
core project. A new plugin model has been introduced in version 2.0 that should help enable third-party development and
support third-party add-ons which may be developed and maintained independently of the core Pi4J project. More info is
provided on [What’s New in 2.0?](https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/).
