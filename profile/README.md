# The Pi4J Project

This project is intended to provide **a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java Programmers** to access the **full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform**. This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to **focus on implementing their application business logic**.

The original library started in 2012 and was last released in 2021 with versions V1.3 (Java 8) and V1.4 (Java 11). V.2 had its first release in August 2021 and brings a new plugin model that helps to enable third-party development and supports third-party add-ons which may be developed and maintained independently of the core Pi4J project. More info is provided on [Whatâ€™s New in 2.0?](https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/). As of V2, Pi4J no longer includes support for peripheral devices and add-on chipsets/boards as part of the core project, to be able to provide a stable platform that can easily be tested.
