# The Pi4J Project

This project is intended to provide **a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for
Java Programmers** to access the **full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform**. This project abstracts
the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to **focus on implementing
their application business logic**.
